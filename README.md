# Location-Predection-Of-Tweets

In this project, We are predicting the location of a tweet posted by a person. Before prediction, I've classified the locations based on the nature of tweets. After building the classification model using ML algorithms, we can predict the location of a new tweet. For fetching the tweet data we made an API call to tweepy and also identifying the geo co-ordinates of the predicted location in order to find out the accuracy.
